## Overview

`"roller"` is an [R](http://www.r-project.org/) package 
that is used to simulate rolling a die/device.

* `device()` creates a device object (of class `"device"`)
* `roll()` tosses a device object, producing a `"roll"` object.
* `summary()` method for a `roll` object provides a frequency table for the rolls.
* `plot()` method for a `"roll"` object to plot frequencies of heads.


## Motivation

This package was developed for homework, and to learn how to truly develop and R package.


## Installation

Install the development version from GitHub via the package `"devtools"`:

```r
# development version from GitHub:
#install.packages("devtools") 
# install "roller" (without vignettes)
devtools::install_github("colefh/roller")
# install "roller" (with vignettes)
devtools::install_github("colefh/roller", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```


## Usage

```{r}
library(roller)
# default device
device1 <- device()
device1
# 1 roll of device1
roll(device1, 1)
# 100 rolls of device1
roll100 <- roll(device1, times = 100)
roll100
# summary
summary(roll100)
# plot
plot(roll100)
# extract
roll100[100]
# replace
roll100[100] <- 1
```
