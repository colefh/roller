## Dice Rolling

The package `"roller"` is a very simple implementation of rolling a multi-sided dice with certain sides and probabilities, and visualizing the outcomes in multiple ways including plots and tables of the frequencies of each side rolled.

## Creating a Device

The first step in rolling a dice is creating the dice (or device) to be rolled. We need to create a `"device"` object using the function `device()`.

```{r}
my_device <- device()
my_device
```

By default, the `device()` function creates a fair, 2 sided object with sides 1 and 2 and probabilites 50% each. You can change the defaults with input arguments `sides` and `prob`.

```{r}
fair_six_sided <- device(sides = 1:6, prob = rep(1/6, 6))
fair_six_sided
loaded_four_sided <- device(sides = 1:4, prob = c(0.7,0.1,0.1,0.1))
loaded_four_sided
```

## Rolling a Device/Dice

Once we've created our device, we can use the `roll()` function to roll the device. We control which device we roll and how many times we roll it with the inputs `device` and `times` respectively. This function will output a list of 4 elements: rolls (the roll outputs), sides (the sides of `device`), prob (the probabilities for each side of `device`), and total (the total number of rolls, e.g. `times`).

```{r}
rolled200 <- roll(device(sides = 1:6, prob = rep(1/6.6)), 200)
rolled200
```

The `summary()` function returns a list containing a data frame of the counts and frequencies of each side rolled.
```{r}
summary200 <- summary(rolled200)
summary200
```

The `plot()` method yields a barchart of the proportions of each side rolled.
```{r}
plot(rolled200)
```

The `"["` (extraction) method allows us to examine individual rolls.
```{r}
rolled200[150]
```

The `"[<-" method allows us to replace the value of a given roll.
```{r}
rolled200[150] <- 5
rolled200[150]
rolled200[150] <- 1
rolled200[150]
```

the `"+"` method allows us to add rolls to an already rolled object.
```{r}
rolled300 <- rolled200 + 100
summary(rolled300)
```
